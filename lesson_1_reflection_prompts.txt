How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Viewing a difference between 2 different files visually is difficult as you need
to go through the entire text line by line to compare these 2 files.
For a human being, it would be a tedious exercise , although we can see
it, but it would be better if there is a tool which could find difference
between 2 versions of the file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

As a programmer, we improve things incrementally be it a code readabilty,
adding new feature, fixing a bug all of these things are being done
incrementally.
Also, if we have a history in place it will be easy to collaborate with
other people as well as your future self.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Manual commit are better than auto commits because you know why you are making
this commit. Aside from this, you are also committing at a logical point.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Applications like google docs, are handling one file at a time.. for instance,
we are working with one word document or excel spreadsheet or powerpoint,
where as when we are working on git, we are making changes to a Project
which consists of multiple files.
For instance, if we are working on a web project, we know that we need
to make changes to html, images, css and javascript.
So, saving multiple files in one commit is a good idea for a VCS like git.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git diff file1 file2

diff file1 file2


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

It makes me more confident because at later point in time, if I want to go back
to the earlier version i can do that. I don't need to write the whole
lot of code again.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I would try to use git for version control.. and I would also like to set up
a git repository.
